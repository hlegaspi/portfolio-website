<!--Objective Section-->
          <p> In this project, I designed a recipe app that helped its users find recipes suited for their
            health needs. My roles included UX/UI designer and UX researcher and the duration
            of the project was 3 months. The purpose of the project was to gain a
            better understanding of the Empathy, Define, and Ideation phases of the Design Thinking Process.
            The objective of the project was to create a responsive recipe app
            that solves the issues that users are facing with current recipe apps and meet their needs.

              <h3> Competitive Analysis </h3>
              <p> To start, I did a competitive analysis of two well-known recipe apps, "Forks Over Knives"
                  and "Kitchen Stories". I found that while the first app had a strong following and a unique plant-based approach,
                  it was costly and lacked variety and nutritional information. For the second app,
                  I found that although they were innovative and appealed to beginners, the options were very limited.

              </picture>
              <h3> User Interviews </h3>
              <p> I conducted user interviews with 3 particpants, a college student, a working professional, and a stay-at-home parent.
                Overall, I found that each of them were concerned with finding healthy and nutritious recipes specific to their diet, understaning the ingredients that
                in those recipes, and having a place to store and organize those recipes.
              </p>

              </picture>
              <h3> User Personas </h3>
              <p> After conducting user interviews and organizing the data, I had
                to define the recipe app's audience. I created 3 user personas from different backgrounds
                and different goals relating to the recipe app.
              </p>

                alt="Userflows Image" class="contentimg">
              </picture>

              <h3> Userflows </h3>
              <p> I had 5 tasks users could accomplish through the recipe app. The first was "users can filter search find recipes suited for their health needs".
                The second task was "users can view nutritional informationon recipes".
                The third task was "users can view each ingredient's information".
                These were important because the app's purpose was to help users find recipes suited to their health conditions.
                The final tasks was "users can see recipe reviews" and "users can log in and bookmark recipes".
              </p>

              </picture>

              <h3> Ideation </h3>
              <p> After defining the audience and the userflow, I went on to creating wireframes.
                As I designed, I used the userflow as a guide and kept in mind the users. For exmaple, I made sure to draw in a search filter screen as it was important for users to find recipes suited to their health needs.

              </picture>

              <h3> Visual Design </h3>
              <p>Once I established what the screens the app needed and their overall layouts, I went on to create
                the visual design. I wanted the app to be colorful because I was inspired by rainbow foods. Colorful foods, which are usually fruits and veggies,
                tend to have lots of nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants. For example, purple fruits and veggies contain anthocyanins, which have many anti-diabetic anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory benefits.
                Green leafy vegetables can help lower the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. I wanted this philosophy to be incorporated in the icons, buttons, and even images. As a side note, I also used material design as a guiding system when designing the mobile layout and the buttons and icons as well.

                        <h3> Mockups </h3>
                        <p> After the establishing the visual design, I designed mockups for the mobile, tablet, and desktop version of the recipe app.

            <p>Overall, I’ve learned a lot about the design thinking process.
              Specifically, I gained a better understanding of the importance of user research in the design thinking process.
              Understanding where users are coming from can help bring to light new ideas and help drive creativity.
